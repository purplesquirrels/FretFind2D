Based on FretFind2d: https://github.com/acspike/FretFind2D

FretFind2D is a fretboard designer for microtonal and multi-scaled stringed instruments.
            (Oh, sure, regular guitars too. But only if you have to.)

Changes:
- Removed jQuery
- Removed all DOM read/writes from the core fretfind engine
- Added new simplified React UI
